Misc. Data Points:

On-Chain data:
1. Current Fetching - Smart Contract or the Native API
	e.g. Compound and Aave APIs

2. Historical Data - Native/Protocol API or the Subgraph (100 results per response limitation)
	Other considerations - Smart Contract Data providers - Infura or Alchemy via changing block numbers


CEX Data:
1. Market Prices - Coingecko Market Prices (USD)
